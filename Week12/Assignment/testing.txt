To allow for the tests to run and not print errors every time, I created enumerated
error codes which cause every function to return as soon as the error code is
changed from PASS. This allows me to test if the program detects the correct problem.
Want to keep the testing in the initial file so it is tested each time a modification
is made.

May need to put this in another program - test parse and test interp (ASK NEILL)
Can I change mvm.c or will it cause errors (ASK NEILL)


strcon doesn't test if single quotes are used - still fails but should it return error message?
All variable/constant functions were tested independently to check that they
returned the correct result, and then tested properly through varcon to check that
they returned syntax errors if the input was invalid - this couldn't be done
using the individual functions because triggering a syntax error just because
something wasn't a string constant would prevent it being evaluated as a number
constant (can only be tested through varcon)

All other aspects of mvm.c remain the same except for insertion order, so this was
tested to make sure it was working properly. All other mvm.c functions were tested in
testmvm.c prior. ( I realise this makes mvm.c have O(n) insertion complexity,
but it was the easiest way of modifying to fit the current task)
